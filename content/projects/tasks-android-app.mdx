## Technologies

- **Java Programming Language**: The programming language used to make this app.
- **Room Database**: The library use to store the app data.

## App Architecture

This app uses the **MVVM (Model View ViewModel)** architecture pattern to
separate concerns and to help in organizing the code. **Model** represents the
data and business logic. **View** is the UI layer. **ViewModel** acts as a
bridge between the View and Model.
