This is a project I made as part of a university course. It is an Android app
that keeps a list of tasks. The app was made using Android Studio.

## Features

- The app saves its data to a database so that it's usable after the app
  restarts.
- Add new tasks to the list, update tasks, and delete tasks by swiping them off
  the list. Also possible to delete all tasks or all completed tasks.
- Filter between all tasks, today's tasks, and important tasks.
- Set tasks as important or completed, and give them a due date.
- Localized to English and Finnish languages.

## Technologies

- **Java Programming Language**:
- **Room Database**:

- **NextJs**: A React framework for building static and dynamic websites.
- **MDX**: A file format that allows you to write JSX in your Markdown files.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for building custom designs.
- **Vercel**: A cloud platform for static sites and serverless functions.

## App Architecture

This app uses the **MVVM (Model View ViewModel)** architecture pattern to
separate concerns and to help in organizing the code. **Model** represents the
data and business logic. **View** is the UI layer. **ViewModel** acts as a
bridge between the View and Model.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you can clone the repository and install the
dependencies:

```bash
git clone
cd next-mdx-portfolio
npm install
```

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The development server will start at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Deployment

To deploy this project, you can use Vercel. You can link your GitHub repository
to Vercel and deploy the project with a single click.

## Conclusion

This portfolio website is a great example of how you can use NextJs and MDX to
build a modern website with dynamic content. By combining the power of NextJs
and MDX, you can create interactive and engaging websites that are easy to
maintain and update.
